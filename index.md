Since Nov. 2022 I am a postdoctoral researcher at SODA Team, INRIA supervised by 
<a href="https://gael-varoquaux.info/">GaÃ«l Varoquaux</a>.
I work on building pretrain models for tabular data from large knowledge bases.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I completed my PhD at Ajou University, South Korea supervised by
<a href="https://alphaminers.ai/">Hyunjung Shin</a>.
My doctoral work focused on graph-based machine learning for multi-layered networks
with applications to biomedical data and history.
</p>

<p>
I am passionate in developing models that leverage multiple sources of data and providing practical frameworks for various applications.
